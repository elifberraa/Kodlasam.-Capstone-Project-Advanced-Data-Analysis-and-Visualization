### Overview

This capstone project represents the culmination of my learning journey at Kodlasam, showcasing the skills, tools, and techniques I've mastered. The goal is to conduct an in-depth analysis of a provided dataset, uncover actionable insights, and present the findings through compelling visualizations using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**.

### Project Workflow

1. **Introduction and Personal Overview**
    - Share a brief background about myself, including my technical expertise and the journey that brought me to this point.
    - Highlight key skills acquired during my training at Kodlasam, such as:
        - Data Analysis (Python, SQL, Power BI)
        - Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI Dashboards)
        - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        - Problem-solving and storytelling with data.
---
2. **Dataset Overview**
    - Provide a comprehensive introduction to the dataset, including:
        - **Data Source:** Describe the dataset’s origin and structure.
        - **Key Tables:** Outline the key tables used and their relationships.
        - **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):** Visualize the dataset’s relationships to guide the analysis.
---
3. **Analysis Objectives**
    - Conduct at least six analyses focusing on different business perspectives, such as:
        1. **Order Analysis:** Trends in order distribution over time.
        2. **Customer Analysis:** Behavior and purchase frequency by location.
        3. **Revenue Analysis:** Monthly, yearly, and location-based revenue trends.
        4. **Product Analysis:** Best-performing product categories and their contribution to revenue.
        5. **Retention Analysis:** Customer retention rates and patterns.
        6. **General Overview:** Holistic insights into the dataset’s key metrics.
    - Use Python for at least two of these analyses, employing libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to generate visual outputs.
---
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis to:
        - Understand data distribution and relationships.
        - Identify outliers, missing values, and anomalies.
        - Highlight trends and patterns that can guide further analysis.
    - Document key findings with visualizations and concise explanations.
---
5. **SQL Queries**
    - Create optimized SQL queries for data extraction and transformation.
    - For outputs that are not suited for visualizations, include screenshots of PostgreSQL query results and briefly interpret them.
---
6. **Power BI Dashboard Creation**
    - Develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize the analysis results. The dashboard will include:
        - Key metrics such as total revenue, customer acquisition, and product performance.
        - Interactive visuals to enable dynamic exploration of the data.
        - Filters for slicing and dicing data by category, region, or time period.
    - **Dashboard Objective:** Provide stakeholders with a clear and interactive overview of the dataset’s insights to support data-driven decision-making.
---
7. **Final Presentation**
    - Prepare a structured presentation to showcase:
        1. **Introduction:** Brief personal overview and project motivation.
        2. **Dataset Overview:** ERD and dataset insights.
        3. **Key Analyses:** Highlight findings from Python, SQL, and Power BI.
        4. **Dashboard Walkthrough:** Demonstrate dashboard interactivity and usability.
        5. **Conclusions and Recommendations:** Summarize actionable insights derived from the data.
   
### Objective

The goal of this capstone project is to demonstrate my ability to analyze complex datasets, derive actionable insights, and present them in an intuitive, visually appealing manner. This project showcases not only technical proficiency but also my ability to think critically and communicate findings effectively.
